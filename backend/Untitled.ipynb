You open bank accounts in your name, and do the same for loans, leases and such. You may call this a <b>sole proprietership</b> if you’re one person, or a <b>partnership</b> if you’re doing this with others.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae8003bc36dd9c06dd1b59\">Otherwise, you might register as an <b>LLC</b> (Limited Liability Company). Why would you register as an LLC? Well, as the name suggests you limit liability. If you get sued or your business has outstanding debts that it can no longer afford, the debtors cannot come after your personal assets.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae809cac9fff6006ccb23e\">One other benefit is that it might just help you keep books separate: it gives you a separate entity and helps you avoid comingling funds. Finally, as we’ll see later: an LLC has a lot of flexibility in how it gets taxed, that a sole proprietorship does not.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae80e39e73fd359cc13c68\">Lastly, you can register as a <b>corporation</b>. Corporations are generally just more rigid than LLCs, and provide well known structures. There are very few things you can do with a corporation that you can’t with an LLC.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae804089e5d7a912f5b6f9\">But - this rigidity is beneficial. Corporations usually insist on a certain governance structure (ie: having a board with officers), and are hence are more predictable to investors. If you’re raising outside investment, it’s pretty common to need to be a corporation. </div><h4 class=\"notion-h notion-h3 notion-h-indent-1 notion-block-1247c5ab9bae8079be38f4a2530ec972\" data-id=\"1247c5ab9bae8079be38f4a2530ec972\"><span><div class=\"notion-header-anchor\" id=\"1247c5ab9bae8079be38f4a2530ec972\"></div><a class=\"notion-hash-link\" href=\"#1247c5ab9bae8079be38f4a2530ec972\" title=\"Tax treatment\"><svg height=\"16\" viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a><span class=\"notion-h-title\">Tax treatment</span></span></h4><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae805da236e7c6b8e9554d\">While incorporation is a matter between you and a state, tax treatment is mostly a matter between you and the IRS. There are two major forms of tax treatment.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae8096ae32c023cde0f4b5\">First, there’s the <b>passthrough</b> tax treatment. Everything is pretty much treated as ordinary income that goes on the members’ tax returns. The business entity itself isn’t taxed, and doesn’t hold money from year to year.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae809cafe0d246136409b7\">This is the simplest form - and often means you can avoid paying a tax-preparer early on. You just file a schedule C with your individual tax return.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae80c09373f59132fe2106\">The other tax treatment is the <b>corporate</b> tax treatment. Here: the corporation by default holds onto money from year to year, and is taxed on its profits annually. If the corporation decides to distribute money to shareholders, it may, and this is usually taxed as a qualified dividend (at a lower tax rate than ordinary income).</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae8042b5d1dd6ebbbe78f2\">One issue here is the so-called “double taxation”: where you’re taxed once at corporate tax rates, and once again on your dividend. But this is less of an issue since the 2017 corporate tax cuts.</div><h4 class=\"notion-h notion-h3 notion-h-indent-1 notion-block-1247c5ab9bae80959fd7ff3e8795635e\" data-id=\"1247c5ab9bae80959fd7ff3e8795635e\"><span><div class=\"notion-header-anchor\" id=\"1247c5ab9bae80959fd7ff3e8795635e\"></div><a class=\"notion-hash-link\" href=\"#1247c5ab9bae80959fd7ff3e8795635e\" title=\"Choose your own tax treatment\"><svg height=\"16\" viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a><span class=\"notion-h-title\">Choose your own tax treatment</span></span></h4><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae8045a202c7b9a87bbd6d\">Which tax treatment applies to your entity?</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae80fcbfb9faee2e3098e8\">If you’re not registered at all, it’s always pass-through.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae80b1909cf1e6f48b996c\">If you’re an LLC: you can choose either!</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae80fd8189dab2160aa5fb\">If you’re a corporation: you can always choose to be treated as a corporation, but in certain circumstances, you can choose to be treated <em>kinda</em> like a passthrough entity.</div><h4 class=\"notion-h notion-h3 notion-h-indent-1 notion-block-1247c5ab9bae80c3a603cf1a59bfe5e2\" data-id=\"1247c5ab9bae80c3a603cf1a59bfe5e2\"><span><div class=\"notion-header-anchor\" id=\"1247c5ab9bae80c3a603cf1a59bfe5e2\"></div><a class=\"notion-hash-link\" href=\"#1247c5ab9bae80c3a603cf1a59bfe5e2\" title=\"S-Corps\"><svg height=\"16\" viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a><span class=\"notion-h-title\">S-Corps</span></span></h4><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae802f8e21d3182ce39aa3\">An S-Corp (ie: a corporation that elects to be treated under Chapter 1 Subsection S of the IRS code) is the aforementioned way to be treated kinda like a passthrough entity.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae8082a9a8e0ee9b56901b\">In particular, an S-Corp is limited to: a) having at most 100 investors, b) being owned by only US residents, c) having only one class of stock. </div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1247c5ab9bae805ea3a2d7af6411e0a5\">The reason I say an S-corp acts <em>kinda</em> like a passthrough entity is because it has subtly different treatment of payroll taxes, that can be beneficial.

Both of these don’t apply to the main flows I’ve investigated above, ie: the above flows only look at <b>distributions</b>. Instead, these deal with stock sale: how much are you taxed at stock sale time?</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1267c5ab9bae80b9855eeed8ef8de166\">This is actually the right way to think about it if you’re starting a company with the goal of it being a high-growth startup: you’re going to make any money not from distributions but from stock sales.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1267c5ab9bae8050bdb0c2f26e78919e\">An 83b election applies to the fact that usually, you have stock vesting over a period of years, and you can instead elect to pay taxes on it all upfront. This is great for founders - since your initial tax value is ~nil, whereas after the 4-5 years of vesting, it could potentially be quite substantial. This also starts the timers on long term capital gains &amp; QSBS earlier!</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1267c5ab9bae80ae94f0f83b8610721d\">Once you own stock, if you sell it after &gt;1y after you acquired it, you’re billed at long-term capital gains instead of ordinary income.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1267c5ab9bae80cca1a4fbfacbcd2e55\">QSBS is an additional benefit: if you acquire stock when the company has less than $50m in assets, and then you sell it &gt;5y after you acquired it, you can exempt upto $10m of gains from taxes. That’s quite significant.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1267c5ab9bae80a282e1ce4327b4fb03\">Neither of these apply to contexts where you don’t sell stock though: so as a passthrough entity, they aren’t really relevant. Additionally, even though LLCs can be treated as C-Corps in some contexts, it seems messy/unclear/unusual to be able to get QSBS benefits for an LLC. It might be possible - but the advice online seems to be split, so contact an accountant.</div></main></div></div>\n",

From the outside it’s quite hard to tell the difference between these two companies:</div><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae8083a30dcfb5b41bd4b7\"><li><b>Company A</b>: Raised a $10m Series A two years ago. They’ve been absolutely crushing growth, their churn is low, their monthly burn is small. They’re clearly past the benchmarks to raise a Series B - and they don’t even entirely need it yet, implying they could raise at great terms.</li></ul><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae804b8432f87cef0113d4\"><li><b>Company B</b>: Raised a $10m Series A two years ago. They’ve been struggling to grow revenue, and their monthly burn is large. They have a pretty short runway and given their current {revenue, valuation} it seems impossible for them to raise a Series B, unless one of their Hail Mary growth strategies work out.</li></ul><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1227c5ab9bae807fbc86c3519d44517d\">You’d rather have options with mediocre terms at Company A than five times as many options with much better terms at Company B. It is in fact possible to disambiguate between Company A and B, with relatively few pieces of data. Here are the questions I would ask to distinguish between them:</div><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae8060967dd251bb37cf7d\"><li>Could you share your most recent pitch deck with me?</li></ul><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae808fba8ee0b23e8aba62\"><li>Could you share a couple of your most recent investor updates with me?</li><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae808fba8ee0b23e8aba62\"><li>The core numbers you want are: revenue, growth, churn, burn, margin and cash in the bank. Feel free to ask for them separately if the founders balk at sharing the deck or investor updates.</li><li>The main signal you’re looking for is “high % YoY growth since the last round, with reasonable runway, margin and churn”</li></ul></ul><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1227c5ab9bae80eba90de9f188c7155c\">A framing that helps make these uncommon requests sound more reasonable: “I’d love to work with you for the long haul, and I realize this will mean that the vast majority of my total wealth will be tied up in Company A stock. Hence I’d love to treat this decision with the weight it deserves and be informed about the state of the company before I accept your offer” </div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1227c5ab9bae803ea2b6f4ddaf3b2981\">Companies may refuse to provide these numbers - which could be a sign that they’re performing poorly. Companies with great metrics are more likely to share, and they often even <a class=\"notion-link\" href=\"https://x.com/james_elicit/status/1821618952562470997\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tweet about their revenue numbers </a>to attract talent. </div><hr class=\"notion-hr notion-block-1227c5ab9bae808887f6e670e881c8ac\"/><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1227c5ab9bae801a8756feb66028369d\">Other than figuring out company value, one other option-related question Ben Kuhn misses in my opinion is:</div><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae808095b6de282970493f\"><li>Has your company held employee secondaries in the past, and do you expect to in the future? </li></ul><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1227c5ab9bae80cb9d22cf9c34dde965\">This isn’t as much of a guarantee as a contractual obligation, but getting a sense of the overall philosophy can be helpful as early employee secondaries get more common. Stock options with frequent liquidity events are worth significantly more than those without.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1227c5ab9bae8075b022d4bd1457a21e\">So, here’s my list of questions, combined with what I consider the best ones from Ben, roughly in order of importance, for an early-stage startup:</div><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae80e5a46fe33d32e55bf9\"><li>Could you share your most recent pitch deck with me?</li></ul><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae8026b73ed1f2a76368f2\"><li>Could you share a couple of your most recent investor updates with me?</li></ul><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae805c8fe8e5bbf2fad4f8\"><li>If I leave or am terminated, when do the options expire?</li></ul><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae8031a7baf4a8f6bd9a7f\"><li>Has your company held employee secondaries in the past, and do you intend to in the future? </li></ul><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae8002a2a0fbb9b26eb8b0\"><li>How many shares is the offer, and how many shares in the company are outstanding?</li></ul><ul class=\"notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-1227c5ab9bae80f5b25ff172b0280c5a\"><li>What were the investment terms of your funding rounds? (Amount invested, post-money valuation, and any liquidation preferences or other protections)</li></ul><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1227c5ab9bae806eb5ffd262b7f62460\">The rest of Ben Kuhn’s questions are useful, but that data is usually given to you with an offer. You should ensure you get the data, but it’s usually unlikely to dramatically change the value of the options. Most companies make pretty standard decisions there and let you know if and when they deviate from them. </div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-1227c5ab9bae80968016ddc42a9962c9\">Hence, the main things that IMO, dramatically change the value of options are company health, post-termination exercise window and founder + VC propensity for secondaries. (And of course, how much of the company you’re actually getting!)</div><div class=\"notion-blank notion-block-1227c5ab9bae8000bb74cb97f6f58bf0\"> </div></main></div></div>\n",

Additionally, stock price growth implies revenue growth and the associated desire for future headcount growth. The company has an extra strong desire to hire and also keep around older employees to help provide the scaffolding of institutional knowledge for new hires. </div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-0a0b86359d9342cdb7bf9aa3bebb4ea2\">In the opposite case, with say, Snapchat stock falling 10x from mid 2021 to mid 2022, employees are particularly likely to leave due to the effective drop in pay, and this is desirable.

He estimates startup equity as worth 30-100% more than face value, due to the fact that the employer commits to continue to sell equity if the employee stays, but the employee has the option to stop buying it by leaving. For big companies, this is weaker, since they have less volatility, and the volatility between various big tech companies is more correlated.

Sans PGBouncer’s connection pooling, Postgres has a much smaller connection limit, in the high double to low triple-digits. There’s a nice post about the trade-offs of PGBouncer <a class=\"notion-link\" href=\"https://jpcamara.com/2023/04/12/pgbouncer-is-useful.html#connection-pooling\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.  Since connection pooling is more suited, or perhaps even necessary for the world where you have ephemeral DB clients, the tradeoff here is a little less clear.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-f7de3a7ef9d04d0e8cc673754a1cdf3c\">So finally, Redis is probably fine. It’s pretty simple, so it doesn’t feel too expensive to add it to your stack. It feels nicer &amp; cleaner to call in this context, and you might end up using it in other contexts.</div><div class=\"notion-text notion-block-5d8443c873c14199b449b217b4832afd\">Postgres is probably fine too. It does seem dubious that it looks like an all-purpose tool, but certain features might just break past some surprisingly scale. But actually yeah, for most apps, it’s 100% fine to hit your DB a few times on every request, and defer moving that to a cache much later. </div><div class=\"notion-blank notion-block-0108e92f86fa4b0985137b40b7cee2c1\"> </div></main></div></div>\n"

       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Fukuoka, Japan – When performing knee replacement surgery, also called total knee arthroplasty, doctors traditionally try to align the hip, knee, and ankle in a straight line, forming a neutral alignment, rather than replicating the patient’s original alignment. Now, in an effort to understand which approach is better, researchers from <a href=\"https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/\">Kyushu University</a> collected convincing evidence in favor of preserving the patient’s native alignment. The study was published in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620X.106B10.BJJ-2023-1425.R1\"><em>The Bone &amp; Joint Journal</em></a> on 1 October, 2024.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">When the knee is damaged due to injury or arthritis, performing daily activities like walking, sitting, and running becomes difficult due to extreme pain. In cases of severe damage, knee replacement surgery is recommended by orthopedic surgeons, to reform the damaged parts of the knee and relieve pain by attaining a neutral alignment.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, this neutral alignment is not always the patient’s original alignment and there is some debate within the orthopedic community on whether restoring the patient’s original alignment can lead to better patient-reported outcomes. In the present study, researchers have attempted to settle this debate and create a comprehensive guide on preoperative planning and execution of knee replacement surgery.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">This study is mostly centered around a classification system called the Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee (CPAK). It categorizes the possible alignments of the knee joint based on two main characteristics. First is the hip-knee-ankle angle; large negative angles cause the knees to be positioned outward, whereas large positive angles cause the knees to point inward. Meanwhile, the second characteristic is the angle of the joint line, which refers to the angle between a line level with the ground and an imaginary line going across the points where the femur meets the tibia.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The research team, which included MD Toshiki Konishi and Associate Professor Satoshi Hamai from the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at <a href=\"https://www.hosp.kyushu-u.ac.jp/En/\">Kyushu University Hospital</a>, sought to determine whether changes in the CPAK categorization before and after knee replacement surgery were associated with notable differences in outcomes. To this end, they collected data from 231 patients who received knee replacement surgery for osteoarthritis at Kyushu University Hospital between 2013 and 2019. Using X-ray images, the team determined the CPAK classification and alignment variables of the patients before and after surgery. They also sent a questionnaire to the patients, from which they derived a series of standardized scores related to symptoms, overall satisfaction, activity levels, and quality of life after the operation.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">After statistical analysis, the researchers revealed that patients who underwent changes in knee alignment after knee replacement surgery, as determined using the CPAK classification, had significantly worse long-term outcomes. Interestingly, they also found that patients whose joint line angle was tilted to the outside of their knee after surgery (away from the other leg) reported overall worse outcomes as well.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">This study demonstrates that precisely replicating a patient’s native alignment during surgery is crucial for ensuring optimal recovery and a higher quality of life. These results could have important implications for how knee replacement surgeries are performed worldwide.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">“In future clinical practice, our findings may guide surgeons in preoperative planning and execution of total knee arthroplasty. By aiming to restore the patient's inherent alignment, patients can achieve superior postoperative outcomes,” explains Konishi. Adding further, he says, “This could help address the challenge of variability in patient outcomes after total knee arthroplasty by providing a more personalized approach to knee alignment, which could become a new standard in orthopedic surgery.”</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Highlighting the fact that this was a retrospective study, the research team now aims to take on a prospective approach in their upcoming work. “We plan to incorporate the CPAK classification into preoperative planning, setting each patient's native knee alignment as the surgical target. Using the robot-assisted technology implemented at our institution, we are now able to perform total knee arthroplasty with high precision, ensuring the accurate reproduction of the preoperative plan,” comments Konishi.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The researchers believe that these efforts will help improve the gold standard of knee replacement surgery, leading to healthier, pain-free, and more active postoperative lives for patients.</p>\n",

       "  <p>A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that weight-loss interventions were associated with improvements in some polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symptoms, including improvement in menstrual frequency, and could be considered a routine treatment option for patients with PCOS. According to the researchers, this is the first review to also show that weight loss interventions were associated with a clinically significant improvement in menstrual frequency, an important outcome identified by those living with PCOS and an indicator for subsequent fertility. This study is published in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>.</p>\n",
       "  <p> </p>\n",
       "  <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford comprehensively searched several scientific research databases for RCTs from database inception until June 2024 comparing interventions aiming to reduce weight against usual care or low-intensity weight-loss interventions in people with PCOS. The researchers conducted this review to address the gap in evidence quantifying the impact of weight loss on the management of PCOS, which makes it particularly challenging for clinicians to advise the potential impacts of weight loss interventions. Pairs of independent reviewers screened the studies and analyzed the impact of weight-intervention on metabolic markers, hormonal markers, gynecological markers and quality of life compared to offering no additional care, usual care (metformin, oral contraceptives, standard advice) or a lower-intensity weight loss intervention (advice for weight loss without support). Interventions included behavioral interventions (diet or physical activity), current or previously licensed weight loss pharmacotherapy (or those which share a class-effect), bariatric surgery, or combinations of such interventions. The researchers also spoke with 36 women who have PCOS to better inform their selection of primary outcomes and presentation of findings. The researchers found that weight loss interventions were associated with greater reductions in glycemic control and hormonal markers including the free androgen index (FAI). These findings indicate that weight loss interventions may be an effective tool for PCOS management in applied clinical settings, and clinicians could use these results to counsel patients with PCOS on the improvements in PCOS markers after weight loss and direct them towards appropriate interventions. </p>\n",

       "  <p>A mixed-methods study found that variations in policies developed to assure safe practice by late-career physicians (LCPs) makes it difficult for these programs to reach their full potential. Interviews conducted with health care organization leaders responsible for implementing such programs revealed varying levels of successes and frustrations. This study is important because it highlights the need for better physician acceptance and improved program rigor to meet policy objectives. The findings are published in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>.</p>\n",
       "  <p> </p>\n",
       "  <p>LCPs, or physicians working beyond age 65 to 75 years, may be at higher risk for delivering unsafe care. To oversee LCPs, some health care organizations have adopted LCP policies requiring cognitive, physical, and practice performance screening assessments. However, little is known about the content or implementation of these policies.</p>\n",
       "  <p> </p>\n",
       "  <p>Researchers from the University of Washington School of Medicine studied LCP policies at 29 health care organizations and interviewed 21 physicians in charge of those policies to characterize key program features and physician perspectives. LCP policies were assessed for rationale and process for adoption, whom the policy covers, assessment methods, actions taken on assessment results, confidentiality and procedural fairness protections, and who executes policy components. The researchers found that the LCP policies at all health care organizations applied to 100 percent of physicians seeking new or renewed clinical privileges and required an age-based screening assessment, with a median starting age of 70 years. Of those, 79.3% required reassessment every two years, and almost all required a physical examination (89.7%) and/or a neuropsychological examination (82.8%). Potential follow-up actions varied widely after a concerning LCP assessment, and 7 policies did not include potential actions after a concerning finding. Many organization leaders cited patient safety as the primary reason for LCP policy implementation and said the top challenges when implementing LCP programs included pushback from physicians, logistical difficulties with program rollout and doubts about predictive accuracy of the assessments. Outcomes data across LCP programs was limited, but the respondents noted the primary effect of the programs was voluntary retirements, with one organization reporting that over a quarter of physicians eligible for the assessment resigned before getting screened.</p>\n",

       "  <p>A new case report published in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> describes the success of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in a patient with HER2-expressing treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC). t-NEPC is an aggressive subtype of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and prior clinical trials with HER2-targeted therapies for mCRPC have failed to show meaningful results.</p>\n",
       "  <p> </p>\n",
       "  <p>Researchers from Washington DC VA Medical Center and The George Washington University detail the case of a 60-year-old Air Force Veteran diagnosed with high-volume metastatic prostate cancer in March of 2019. He was first treated with androgen-deprivation therapy and docetaxel, but tumor progression occurred. He received six additional therapies, including participation in three clinical trials, over the course of four years. His response to all treatments was short-lived and followed by rapid disease progression, and he subsequently developed brain metastases. Tissue biopsy confirmed the patient now had t-NEPC, and testing for HER2 by immunohistochemistry showed a strong expression in both his prostate tumor and brain metastasis. In February 2024, he started off-label treatment with T-DXd. After 4 cycles, a 57% overall reduction in tumor volume was seen across sites, including the brain. His clinical status improved significantly despite being told several months before starting T-DXd that he should transition to hospice care due to a lack of treatment options. The case suggests that T-DXd has anti-tumor activity in HER2-expressing mCRPC, including aggressive subtypes like t-NEPC. The researchers also note that this case highlights the need for testing HER2 expression using immunohistochemistry, which is not routinely done for patients with advanced prostate cancer to better identify patients who might benefit from T-DXd treatment. As of October 2024, patient is clinically doing well.</p>\n",

The researchers used geocoding software to calculate travel time between patient homes and healthcare provider addresses, including office visits, emergency department (ED) visits, and inpatient stays. They found that the median travel time for physician office visits was about 14 minutes inside and 28 minutes outside metropolitan statistical aeras.  The median travel time for physician office visits to specialists was nearly 42 minutes outside of metropolitan statistical areas.   The median travel time for ED visits was 13.6 minutes and for inpatients stays was 18.1 minutes. Only half of primary care visits fell within a primary care service area (PCSA), while nearly 40% of inpatient stays fell outside of defined hospital service areas.  Based on the data collected, the researchers found that some geographic market definitions exclude much of the care utilized by residents. This data can inform choices of market definitions and provide national benchmarks for patient travel time. </p>\n",

       "  <p>To address that, a new study in the journal <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em> tested the effects of conventional polyester fibres and two bio-based fibres –viscose and lyocell – on earthworms, a species critical to the health of soils globally.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The study found that in high concentrations of fibres, 30% of earthworms died after 72 hours when exposed to polyester, while those exposed to the bio-based fibres experienced much higher mortality of up to 60% in the case of lyocell and 80% for viscose.</p>\n",
       "  <p>A second experiment, using environmentally relevant concentrations of the fibres, indicated that earthworms housed in soils containing viscose fibres exhibited reduced reproduction compared to those exposed to polyester fibres. Earthworms in the soils containing lyocell fibres showed reduced growth and also higher rates of burrowing within the soil compared to exposure to the other types of fibre.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The researchers say the study highlights the complex nature of global efforts to reduce the threat of microplastic pollution, and the importance of testing new materials being advocated as alternatives to plastics before they are released on the open market.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The study was carried out as part of the BIO-PLASTIC-RISK project, led by researchers at the University of Plymouth and the University of Bath, and supported with £2.6million funding by the Natural Environmental Research Council.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Dr Winnie Courtene-Jones, lead author on the new study and now a Lecturer in Marine Pollution at Bangor University, said: <em>“Over 320,000 tonnes of bio-based and biodegradable fibres were produced globally in 2022 and research shows that substantial  quantities of that will end up in the environment. However, evidence of their ecological impacts has been lacking. Our study has shown that bio-based fibres have a range of adverse effects on earthworms – animals which are critical to the functioning of the environment. It highlights the importance of gathering further evidence before alternatives to conventional plastics are made available even more widely.”</em></p>\n",
       "  <p>The new study follows research published earlier in 2024 which highlighted that being exposed to the materials used in biodegradable teabags can result in earthworm populations experiencing up to 15% greater mortality, and have a detrimental effect on earthworm reproduction.</p>\n",
       "  <p>It has been published just a few weeks before the United Nations gathers world leaders meet in Busan, South Korea, for the final round of negotiations regarding a possible Global Plastics Treaty.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Professor Richard Thompson OBE FRS, senior author on the new study and Head of the University of Plymouth’s International Marine Litter Research Unit, will be at those discussions along with policy makers, scientists and other delegates from across the world.</p>\n",
       "  <p>He added: <em>“It is clear that along with recycling and re-use, tackling plastic pollution will require a reduction in the quantities of plastics used and produced. There is increasing interest in alternative materials that could be used as substitutes for plastic, but this publication further emphasises the importance of testing new innovations in relevant environmental settings prior to widescale adoption. I firmly believe it is possible to tackle the plastic pollution crisis, but independent scientific evidence will be critical in helping us avoid unintended consequences as we look for solutions.”</em></p>\n",

       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">A new study published in <em>Environmental Science and Ecotechnology</em> highlights the health benefits of kitchen renovation as a cost-effective way to mitigate household air pollution in rural China. With over three billion people globally still relying on solid fuels like wood and coal for cooking, household air pollution remains a major public health issue. Researchers found that simple kitchen improvements, such as separating cooking areas and installing ventilation fans, could significantly reduce exposure to harmful pollutants.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The study, conducted by a team from Peking University, surveyed household kitchens across rural China. While 82% of rural households have separated kitchens, only 34% use mechanical ventilation. The use of ventilation fans was linked to higher income and education levels, indicating that affordability and awareness are key barriers.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The researchers estimated that widespread implementation of ventilation and separated kitchens could reduce PM2.5 exposure by 23%, potentially preventing over 67,000 premature deaths annually. This represents a health benefit valued at $19 billion per year, far exceeding the $12 billion cost of renovations.</p>\n",
       "  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">\"Kitchen renovation offers an affordable solution to reduce the health impacts of household air pollution in rural areas, particularly where transitioning to cleaner energy is challenging,\" said Dr. Guofeng Shen, lead researcher from Peking University. \"Our findings highlight the need for government initiatives to promote ventilation systems and improve kitchen design, especially in low-income communities.\"</p>\n",

       "  <p>In a breakthrough study published this week in <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407112121\"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, researchers in the Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) at the University of Hawai‘i (UH) at Mānoa have shown that, contrary to most projections, coral reefs are not inevitably doomed, but have the potential to persist and adapt over time, if carbon emissions are curbed and local stressors are addressed. This work was conducted by the Toonen-Bowen “ToBo” Lab, with partners across UH Mānoa and The Ohio State University.</p>\n",
       "  <p>In an island-based laboratory adjacent to the coral reefs they study, HIMB researchers created 40 experimental systems known as “mesocosms,” which mimic the diversity and environment of a coral reef in the wild. The mesocosms included eight of the most common Hawaiian coral species, reef sand, rubble, and a menagerie of creatures which helped represent one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. For two years, the team exposed the mesocosms to different scenarios of higher temperature, higher acidity, or a combination of both ocean stressors to see how the reef communities would react to future climate scenarios.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“We included the eight most common coral species in Hawai‘i, which constitute about 95% of the coral cover on Hawaiian reefs, and many of the most common coral types across the Pacific and Indian Oceans,” explains HIMB post-doctoral researcher and lead author of the study, Christopher Jury. “By understanding how these species respond to climate change, we should have a better understanding of how Hawaiian reefs and other Indo-Pacific reefs will change over time, and how to better allocate resources as well as plan for the future.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>Reef structures form over time through a process known as “calcification” where individual coral organisms—or polyps—build their own skeletons by secreting a salt known as calcium carbonate, which becomes limestone. Coral reefs are naturally eroded by a variety of species, and if the balance between reef producers and reef eroders shifts, coral reefs could disappear, and the huge diversity of species which live on coral reefs would have nowhere to live.</p>\n",
       "  <p>As the ToBo lab research team controlled levels of temperature and acidity in the mesocosms, they measured the calcification responses of the eight species of coral, the reef communities, and the biodiversity of these systems. Their findings were entirely unexpected.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“These experimental reef communities persisted as new reef communities rather than collapsing,” shares Jury. “This was a very surprising result, since almost all projections of reef futures suggest that the corals should have almost entirely died, the reef communities should have experienced net carbonate dissolution, and reef biodiversity should have collapsed. None of those things happened in this study.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>Their results are unique, and so is the ToBo lab’s approach to how they study their subject.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“Rather than focusing on just one or two species in isolation, we included the entire complement of reef species from microbes, to algae, invertebrates, and fish, under realistic conditions they would experience in nature,” notes Rob Toonen, co-director of the UH Marine Biology Graduate Program, HIMB Professor and Ruth Gates Endowed Chair, and co-senior author of the study. “These more realistic mesocosm experiments help us to understand how coral reefs will change over time.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>These findings suggest that coral conservation in a changing world is possible, but urgent action is essential for these unique ecosystems to persist.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“Reefs are not inevitably doomed,” emphasizes Jury. “The recognition that coral reefs are not doomed if we take appropriate action on climate change and local stressors reinforces the need to accomplish these goals. Under potential future ocean warming and acidification, coral reef communities will change substantially, but are unlikely to collapse if global change is limited to Paris Climate Agreement targets and local stressors are adequately addressed.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, and they support hundreds of millions of people around the world. As our planet rapidly changes in unprecedented ways, coral reefs are under severe threat due to ocean warming and acidification. This study shows that with effective and timely climate change mitigation measures in place, coral reefs will continue to change, but global reef collapse may still be avoidable.</p>\n",

       "  <p>Scientists have long suspected the keto diet might be able to calm an overactive immune system and help some people with diseases like multiple sclerosis.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Now, they have reason to believe it could be true.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Scientists at UC San Francisco have discovered that the diet makes the gut and its microbes produce two factors that attenuated symptoms of MS in mice.</p>\n",
       "  <p>If the study translates to humans, it points toward a new way of treating MS and other autoimmune disorders with supplements.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The keto diet severely restricts carbohydrate-rich foods like bread, pasta, fruit and sugar, but allows unlimited fat consumption.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Without carbohydrates to use as fuel, the body breaks down fat instead, producing compounds called ketone bodies. Ketone bodies provide energy for cells to burn and can also change the immune system.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Working with a mouse model of MS, the researchers found that mice who produced more of a particular ketone body, called β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), had less severe disease.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The additional βHB also prompted the gut bacterium <em>Lactobacillus murinus</em> to produce a metabolite called indole lactic acid (ILA). This blocked the activation of T helper 17 immune cells, which are involved in MS and other autoimmune disorders.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“What was really exciting was finding that we could protect these mice from inflammatory disease just by putting them on a diet that we supplemented with these compounds,” said <a href=\"https://profiles.ucsf.edu/peter.turnbaugh\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Turnbaugh</a>, PhD, of the <a href=\"https://microbiome.ucsf.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Benioff Center for Microbiome Medicine</a>.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Earlier, Turnbaugh had shown that when secreted by the gut, βHB counteracts immune activation. This prompted a postdoctoral scholar who was then working in his lab, Margaret Alexander, PhD, to see if the compound could ease the symptoms of MS in mice.</p>\n",
       "  <p>In the new study, which appears Nov. 4 in <em><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)01242-7__;!!LQC6Cpwp!sH5wvhQJqOqVKADYre0LwD4rf7yNFmDKlF3Qo6EF1vZA4elCoPQQMjnMdUmKLFfhsY6GQN362QsYXDULTg2ov9SYGDfqrgk$\" target=\"_blank\">Cell Reports</a></em>, the team looked at how the ketone body-rich diet affected mice that were unable to produce βHB in their intestines, and found that their inflammation was more severe.</p>\n",
       "  <p>But when the researchers supplemented their diets with βHB, the mice got better.</p>\n",
       "  <p>To find out how βHB affects the gut microbiome, the team isolated bacteria from the guts of three groups of mice that were fed either the keto diet, a high-fat diet, or the βHB supplemented high-fat diet.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Then, they screened the metabolic products of each group’s distinct microbes in an immune assay and determined that the positive effects of the diet were coming from a member of the <em>Lactobacillus</em> genus: <em>L. murinus</em>.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Two other techniques, genome sequencing and mass spectrometry, confirmed that the L. murinus they found produced indole lactic acid, which is known to affect the immune system.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Finally, the researchers treated the MS mice with either ILA or L. murinus, and their symptoms improved.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Turnbaugh cautioned that the supplement approach still needs to be tested in people with autoimmune disorders.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“The big question now is how much of this will translate into actual patients,” he said. “But I think these results provide hope for the development of a more tolerable alternative to helping those people than asking them stick to a challenging restrictive diet.”</p>\n",

       "  <p>The <strong>origins of writing in Mesopotamia </strong>lie in the images imprinted by ancient cylinder seals on clay tablets and other artifacts. A research group from the University of Bologna has identified a series of correlations between the designs engraved on these cylinders, dating back around six thousand years, and some of the signs in the proto-cuneiform script that emerged in the city of Uruk, located in what is now southern Iraq, around 3000 BCE.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The study—published in <em>Antiquity</em>—opens new perspectives on understanding the birth of writing and may help researchers not only to gain new insights <strong>into the meanings of the designs on cylinder seals</strong> but also<strong> to decipher many still-unknown signs in proto-cuneiform</strong>.</p>\n",

       "  <p>Among the first cities to emerge in Mesopotamia, <strong>Uruk </strong>was an immensely important centre throughout the fourth millennium BCE, exerting influence over a large region extending from southwestern Iran to southeastern Turkey.</p>\n",
       "  <p>In this region, cylinder seals were created. Typically made of stone and engraved with a series of designs,<strong> these cylinders were rolled onto clay tablets</strong>, leaving a stamped impression of the design.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Starting in the mid-fourth millennium BCE, cylinder seals were used<strong> as part of an accounting system</strong> to track the production, storage, and transport of various consumer goods, particularly agricultural and textile products.</p>\n",
       "  <p>It is in this context that <strong>proto-cuneiform</strong> appeared: an archaic form of writing made up of hundreds of pictographic signs, more than half of which remain undeciphered to this day. Like cylinder seals, proto-cuneiform was used for accounting, though its use is primarily documented in southern Iraq.</p>\n",
       "  <p>\"The close relationship between ancient sealing and the invention of writing in southwest Asia has long been recognised, but the relationship between specific seal images and sign shapes has hardly been explored,\" says <strong>Ferrara</strong>. \"This was our starting question: did seal imagery contribute significantly to the invention of signs in the first writing in the region?\"</p>\n",
       "  <p>To find an answer, the researchers systematically compared the designs on the cylinders with proto-cuneiform signs,<strong> looking for correlations </strong>that might reveal direct relationships in both graphic form and meaning.  </p>\n",
       "  <p>\"We focused on seal imagery that originated before the invention of writing, while continuing to develop into the proto-literate period,\" add <strong>Kathryn Kelley</strong> and <strong>Mattia Cartolano</strong>, both researchers at the University of Bologna and co-authors of the study. \"This approach allowed us to identify a series of designs related to the transport of textiles and pottery, which later evolved into corresponding proto-cuneiform signs.\"</p>\n",
       "  <p>This discovery reveals, for the first time<strong>, a direct link between the cylinder seal system and the invention of writing</strong>, offering new perspectives for studying the evolution of symbolic and writing systems.</p>\n",
       "  <p>\"Our findings demonstrate that the designs engraved on cylinder seals are directly connected to the development of proto-cuneiform in southern Iraq,\" confirms <strong>Silvia Ferrara</strong>. \"They also show how the meaning originally associated with these designs was integrated into a writing system.\"</p>\n",
       "  <p>The study was published in <em>Antiquity </em>under the title Seals and signs: tracing the origins of writing in ancient Southwest Asia.

       "  <p>For generations, the federal government has largely refrained from paying for mental health and substance use treatment in large residential facilities.</p>\n",
       "  <p>That changed in 2015 when, in response to increasing overdose deaths nationwide from illicit drugs, the federal government allowed states to waive a longstanding prohibition against using federal Medicaid funding for services in so-called institutions of mental diseases. In turn, states were required to improve their addiction care with an emphasis on increasing treatment with medications.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Yet a new study by researchers at Oregon Health &amp; Science University finds no overall benefit in terms of increased treatment or decrease in nonfatal overdoses among the 17 states that received those waivers between 2017 and 2019, compared with 18 that did not. Medicaid is a joint federal-state health insurance program that covers about 90 million Americans, although not every state extends Medicaid coverage to all low-income adults.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2024.00461\">study published today in this month’s edition of the journal <em>Health Affairs</em></a>.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“The waivers have been important to update Medicaid’s program to treat opioid use disorder, however they alone do not appear to have meaningfully improved the situation in terms of uptake of medication to treat opioid use disorders or in reducing overdoses,” said lead author <strong>Stephan Lindner, Ph.D.</strong>, associate professor in the OHSU Center for Health Systems Effectiveness and a faculty member of the OHSU-Portland State University School of Public Health.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Lindner noted that the null result highlights the fact that the waivers may be necessary but are clearly insufficient to bring the nation’s overdose epidemic under control.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“These waivers started about 10 years ago,” he said. “Back then, about 50,000 people died of drug overdoses per year. Fast forward 10 years, and more than 100,000 people die of drug overdoses in the United States per year.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“We have made some progress in addressing the opioid crisis, but we need more substantial action at the federal level to make sure all people with opioid use disorder get the treatment they need.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>Waivers aren’t enough, but Lindner pointed to several initiatives backed by research and law that could better address the nation’s illicit drug overdose crisis:</p>\n",
       "  <ul>\n",
       "  <li><strong>Treatment across the full spectrum of care</strong>. A <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6\">federal law</a> sponsored by former U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, R-Hood River, in 2018 already requires states to cover the three FDA-approved medications to treat opioid use disorder (methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone), however Lindner said enforcement may have been lax.</li>\n",
       "  <li><strong>Improve access to methadone</strong>. Research, including <a href=\"https://news.ohsu.edu/2021/07/28/ease-access-to-opioid-addiction-medication-new-research-suggests\">a series of evidence reviews conducted at OHSU</a>, recommends easing access to methadone, which has historically been dispensed only in specialized clinics. A <a href=\"https://news.ohsu.edu/2024/06/19/french-model-shows-better-access-to-methadone-in-u-s-could-save-lives\">recent study</a> by OHSU physician Honora Englander, M.D., found that 87% of people with opioid use disorder in France received access to methadone compared with less than 20% in the United States.</li>\n",
       "  <li><strong>Step up distribution of life-saving naloxone</strong>. OHSU recently hosted a series of events <a href=\"https://news.ohsu.edu/2024/08/26/ohsu-expands-access-to-life-saving-naloxone-for-young-people\">promoting the widespread distribution of naloxone</a> to reverse overdoses, especially to young people.</li>\n",
       "  <li><strong>Increase access to buprenorphine</strong>. Previous research by Lindner found that access to buprenorphine <a href=\"https://news.ohsu.edu/2023/06/23/treatment-for-opioid-use-disorder-varies-widely-among-states-study-finds\">varied widely</a> between U.S. states.

       "  <p>As the hunt for effective cancer therapies intensifies, some scientists are turning back to look at old drugs in a new light. The anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine is one such drug that has been “repurposed” to fight cancer. Despite its effectiveness at blocking the resupply of needed resources to cancer cells, clinical trial results have been disappointing, in part because cancer cells eventually become resistant to the drug.</p>\n",
       "  <p>A Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center team led by <a href=\"https://musc.service-now.com/cgs?id=cgs_profile&amp;profile_id=5fde26a2c3aa4ad0c9ba1e75e0013114\">Joe Delaney, Ph.D.</a>, reports in<em> Cell Cycle</em> that resistance to hydroxychloroquine occurs not by restoring the cancer cells’ recycling ability, as had been expected. Rather, resistance develops due to changes in the division, metabolism and export pathways of cancer cells. These findings open the door for new combination treatments, as drugs targeting these newly identified resistance mechanisms can be administered along with hydroxychloroquine to improve outcomes.</p>\n",
       "  <p><strong>The promise of repurposed drugs</strong><br/>\n",
       "  <br/>\n",
       "  Repurposing old drugs for new treatments is not a new concept. Aspirin was originally used as a painkiller, but after the discovery of its anti-coagulant properties, it was repurposed as a blood thinner to treat heart disease. Thalidomide, the infamous anti-nausea medication, has been recently repurposed as a treatment for certain types of cancer and even leprosy. As cancer therapy moves increasingly toward specific single-protein targets, some scientists, like Delaney, are swinging back to look at preexisting drugs to find robust, multi-target effects.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“Targeting single proteins can be extremely effective to treat cancer,” said Delaney. “However, the more specific the treatment becomes, the more likely resistance is to occur.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>Imagine a hotel hallway, and behind each door is a route for cancer development. Targeting single proteins is like welding one of the doors shut. It’s impossible to get through that door, but it’s just a matter of time before cancer picks the lock on another door and gets in. That’s why these old drugs are so promising, said Delaney – their breadth of targets padlocks several doors at once, making it that much harder for a cancer cell to work around them.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“These older molecules usually work because they have many, many targets within the cell,” he said. “If we can figure out how to use them correctly, it's harder for cancer cells to mutate all those different points that they are acting on.”</p>\n",
       "  <p><strong>The cancer-fighting promise and limitations of hydroxychloroquine</strong></p>\n",
       "  <p>Originally used as a treatment for malaria, hydroxychloroquine began to be explored as a cancer therapy in the mid-2000s. The drug is known to block autophagy, a process that essentially acts as a cell’s clean-up crew.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Autophagy literally means “self-eating.” It enables cancer cells to gather up old or damaged cellular machinery and send it off either to be thrown out or recycled.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“When we think of cancer, we think of uncontrolled dividing cells,” said Delaney. “Autophagy is one of those processes that really enables a cancer cell to do just that by resupplying it with resources needed for survival and division.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>Despite the drug’s promise of killing cancer cells by blocking cellular recycling, most clinical trials using the drug have been disappointing.  </p>\n",
       "  <p>“What we don't know is why so many of these clinical trials have failed,” said Delaney. “We're trying to figure out why hydroxychloroquine works or doesn't work in certain situations in cancer.”</p>\n",
       "  <p><strong>A surprising finding about resistance to hydroxychloroquine</strong></p>\n",
       "  <p>To answer these questions, researchers in the Delaney Lab embarked on a multi-omics exploration into hydroxychloroquine’s effect on ovarian and colorectal cancer cells. They treated cells with hydroxychloroquine and then used two different whole-genome screens to identify exactly what the cells were doing to evade hydroxychloroquine attacks. With these approaches, they were able to observe how cells activated or deactivated different cellular pathways in response to continued hydroxychloroquine exposure.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“By using two completely different methods, we were able to home in on the true biological players in the system,” said Delaney.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The researchers were surprised to find that cells weren’t modifying autophagy to survive –the door that was expected to be opened really wasn’t touched at all. Instead, cancer cells were surviving hydroxychloroquine by changing their metabolism, division and export pathways.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“We thought the main interaction of hydroxychloroquine with cancer was this process of autophagy, but it appears instead that processes unrelated to autophagy may be the most important for cancer cells to survive this therapy,” said Delaney.</p>\n",
       "  <p><strong>Setting the stage for novel combination therapies</strong></p>\n",
       "  <p>With this discovery, the Hollings team hopes to identify drugs that could be administered along with hydroxychloroquine to prevent the cancer cells from becoming resistant to this therapy.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“Our study has identified the potential mechanisms that we will need to target with a second drug to prevent resistance against hydroxychloroquine,” said Delaney.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Combining hydroxychloroquine with drugs that affect cell division, metabolism or export could increase the effectiveness of the treatment. Additionally, using hydroxychloroquine to treat patients with cancers that already have defects in one of these newly identified pathways could be a very powerful intervention. Finally, patients without these defects could be directed to potentially more effective, less resistant treatments.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“We certainly want to understand which patients would see the most benefit to get the best result from these trials,” Delaney said.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Ultimately, these results from the Delaney Lab shed light on how repurposed drugs like hydroxychloroquine can be used to fight cancer more effectively. Specifically, they show that cancer cells resist hydroxychloroquine in unexpected ways. By using such information, scientists can create more effective combination treatments against cancer.</p>\n",

       "  <p>Between long commutes, Zoom-packed workdays and evenings of streaming and scrolling, millennials now spend more than 60 hours per week sitting, potentially boosting their heart disease risk and accelerating other signs of aging, according to new CU Boulder and University of California Riverside research.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The study of more than 1,000 former or current Colorado residents, including 730 twins, is among the first to explore how prolonged sitting impacts health measures such as cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) in young adults.</p>\n",
       "  <p>It found that meeting the minimum recommended physical activity guidelines—about 20 minutes per day of moderate exercise—isn’t enough to counter the hazards of spending most waking hours in a seat.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“Our research suggests that sitting less throughout the day, getting more vigorous exercise, or a combination of both may be necessary to reduce the risk of premature aging in early adulthood,” said the study’s senior author Chandra Reynolds, a professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience and the Institute for Behavioral Genetics.</p>\n",
       "  <p>For the study, published in the journal <em>PLOS ONE</em>, Reynolds teamed up with first author Ryan Bruellman, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics at UC Riverside.</p>\n",
       "  <p>After the COVID pandemic, Bruellman noticed that he and other people his age were sitting more. He set out to learn more about the consequences.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“Young adults tend to think they are impervious to the impacts of aging. They figure, ‘My metabolism is great, I don’t have to worry until I’m in my 50s or 60s,’” said Bruellman. “But what you do during this critical time of life matters.”</p>\n",
       "  <p><strong>A walk after work isn’t enough</strong><br/>\n",
       "  <br/>\n",
       "  The authors analyzed data from participants ranging in age from 28 to 49, average age 33, from CU’s Colorado Adoption/Twin Study of Lifespan behavioral development and cognitive aging  (CATSLife), which has followed twins and adopted individuals since childhood.</p>\n",
       "  <p>On average, participants reported sitting almost 9 hours daily, with some sitting as much as 16 hours. They reported between 80 and 160 minutes of moderate physical activity on average weekly and less than 135 minutes of vigorous exercise weekly. The authors note that these results are likely better than national averages due to Colorado’s active lifestyle.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The researchers looked at two key measures of heart and metabolic aging: total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein and body mass index (BMI). The study found that, essentially, the more one sat, the older one looked. And adding a little moderate activity on top of a long day of sitting did little to buffer these impacts.</p>\n",
       "  <p>In fact, young adults who sat 8.5 hours per day and performed at or below current exercise recommendations could enter a “moderate to high risk” category for cardiovascular and metabolic disease, the authors said.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“Taking a quick walk after work may not be enough,” said Reynolds. “While this is increasingly apparent with age, we show that associations are already emerging in early adulthood.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>Adding vigorous activity did have a buffering effect.</p>\n",
       "  <p>For instance, those who exercised vigorously (think running or cycling) for 30 minutes daily had cholesterol and BMI measures that looked like those of individuals five to 10 years younger who sat as much as they did but didn’t exercise.</p>\n",
       "  <p>But even vigorous activity could not fully buffer the negative impacts of prolonged sitting, the study concluded.</p>\n",
       "  <p><strong>Same genes, different lifestyles</strong><br/>\n",

       "  <p>Scientists and environmental activists have consistently called for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline\"><u>drastic reductions</u></a> in meat production as a way to reduce emissions and, in doing so, combat climate change. However, a new analysis concludes that a smaller reduction, borne by wealthier nations, could remove 125 billion tons of carbon dioxide—exceeding the total number of global fossil fuel emissions over the past three years—from the atmosphere. </p>\n",
       "  <p>Small cutbacks in higher-income countries—approximately 13% of total production—would reduce the amount of land needed for cattle grazing, the researchers note, allowing forests to naturally regrow on current pastureland. The return of trees—<a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/features/trees-are-climate-change-carbon-storage-heroes#:~:text=In%20one%20year%2C%20a%20mature,atmosphere%2C%20like%20fire%20or%20decomposition.\"><u>long known to effectively absorb, or sequester, carbon dioxide</u></a> (CO<sub>2</sub>)—would drive significant declines in fossil fuel emissions, which the study’s authors estimate would roughly equal three years’ worth of global emissions. </p>\n",
       "  <p>“We can achieve enormous climate benefits with modest changes to the total global beef production,” says Matthew N. Hayek, an assistant professor in New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies and the lead author of the analysis, which appears in the journal <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> (<em>PNAS</em>). “By focusing on regions with potentially high carbon sequestration in forests, some restoration strategies could maximize climate benefits while minimizing changes to food supplies.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>The analysis found that pasturelands, especially in areas that were once forests, hold immense promise for mitigating climate change. When livestock are removed from these “potential native forest” areas, ecosystems can revert to their natural forested state, capturing carbon in trees and soil.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The paper’s authors see high- and upper-middle-income countries as viable candidates for reduction in beef production because they have some current pasture areas that do not produce very much grass per acre, exist where grass grows only during a short growing season, and are in areas that could, instead, grow vast, lush forests with deep soils that work to sequester carbon. This differs significantly from other regions, including sub-Saharan Africa and South America, where much more pasture can grow year-round, producing more feed for animals per acre than northern countries. In addition, the research team sees ways lower-income regions could increase the efficiency at which cattle are fed and raised on grass as a way to offset the minor loss in production from higher-income countries.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“This isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution,” Hayek emphasizes. “Our findings show that strategic improvements in the efficiency of cattle herds in some areas, coupled with decreased production in others, could lead to a win-win scenario for climate and food production.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>The study reveals an even more dramatic potential for climate mitigation if the scope of restoration was expanded. The researchers found that removing cattle, sheep, and other grazing livestock from all potentially natively forested areas globally could sequester a staggering 445 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> by the end of this century—the equivalent to more than a decade of current global fossil fuel emissions. </p>\n",
       "  <p>“Importantly, this approach would still allow livestock grazing to remain on native grasslands and dry rangelands, which are places where crops or forests cannot easily grow,” says Hayek. “These areas support more than half of global pasture production, meaning that this ambitious forest restoration scenario would require cutting global cattle, sheep, and other livestock herds by less than half. These findings underscore the immense potential of natural forest restoration as a climate solution.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>The <em>PNAS</em> study used remote sensing technology to track pasture productivity—the amount of grass produced annually that livestock can consume—in order to estimate the climate benefits that reductions would yield.</p>\n",
       "  <p>“Even if two different areas can regrow the same amount of carbon in trees, we can now know how much pasture, hence beef production, we would have to lose in each area to grow those trees back,” explains Johannes Piipponen, a doctoral candidate at Finland’s Aalto University and coauthor of the study, who led this technical advance. “For many consumers in high-income regions, like Europe and North America, reducing excessive meat consumption benefits both their health and the environment. However, until now, it has remained rather unclear where the required decreases in production could begin.” </p>\n",
       "  <p>Maps produced by the team’s research can identify areas where policies could be prioritized for reducing beef production and hastening forest recovery—for instance, by offering forest land conservation incentives or buyouts to beef producers.</p>\n",
       "  <p>The authors acknowledge that ecosystem regrowth is not a substitute for efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions. But, it can serve as a powerful complement to combat climate change. </p>\n",
       "  <p>“In many places, this regrowth could occur by seeds naturally dispersing and trees regrowing without any human involvement,” says Hayek. “However, in some places, with especially degraded environments or soils, native and diverse tree-planting could accelerate forest restoration, giving regrowth a helping hand. This long-term regrowth would benefit the climate for decades to come, with significant regrowth and carbon capture beginning within just a few years in many areas, and lasting for 75 years or more until forests nearly mature.”</p>\n",
       "  <p>The authors also emphasize that while the findings do not call for extreme changes to global food production and trade patterns, swift action is necessary in order to meet climate goals. </p>\n",
       "  <p>“Within the next two decades, countries are aiming to meet critical climate mitigation targets under international agreements, and ecosystem restoration on converted pasturelands can be a critical part of that,” observes Hayek. “Our study’s findings could offer paths forward for policymakers aiming to address both climate mitigation and food security concerns. As countries worldwide commit to<a href=\"https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/\"> <u>ambitious reforestation targets</u></a>, we hope that this research can help identify and prioritize the most effective areas for carbon sequestration efforts while considering global food needs.”</p>\n",
